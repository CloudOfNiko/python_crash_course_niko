# This code uses a list to store and call on some laptop brands for them to be called for use in some printed statements.

laptops = ['msi', 'hp', 'razer', 'lenovo', 'asus']

print(f"I've been looking at different laptops recently, and I think an {laptops[-1].upper()} one would suit me the best.")
print(f"Although I have some {laptops[2].title()} periphery, I don't know if I like the software for it.")
print(f"{laptops[-2].title()} might be good, but only for office and business application.")
